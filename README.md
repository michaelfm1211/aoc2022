Here are my solutions to the
[2022 Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2022).

These solutions might not be the fastest to write, fastest to run, or best
overall. Instead, they are the solutions I wrote.

Days 1-15 and 18 were done during December, however the rest were done after
the new year. For every day there are at least two files. The `a` version is
part one and the `b` version is part two. For some days there may be a `c`
version too. The `c` version is another solution for either `a` or `b` after
I had solved the solution. The `c` solution is written in retrospect, however
it may or may not be faster than the original solution I wrote.
